		Welcome to the 8th edition of
		Ndalat Gaa Cross-country.
		In this edition we pay special
		tribute to our departed hero the Late
		Isaiah F. Kiplagat who was the founder
		of this race together with other greats
		like the Late Mzee Wilson Koech.
		Both of these heroes succumbed to
		cancer and in this year we dedicate this
		race to the fight against this killer dis-
		ease.
		Ndalat Gaa Cross-country has been
		able to live upto its ambition of touch-
		ing lives of communities within and
		without Ndalat Gaa. It has given birth
		to athletes who have won major inter-
		national races.
		Through partnering, we have been able
		to make this event a success. We thank
		our partners for walking with us.
